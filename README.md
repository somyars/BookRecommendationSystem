# BookRecommendationSystem

# Motivation
Book recommendation system aims to provide recommendations to a user based on
item-based collaborative filtering (personalized recommendations) as well as “New
Releases” and “Popular Books” which will be typically non-personalized
recommendations. Such a powerful recommendation system would enhance the user
experience and eventually increase revenue. It focuses on enhancing the customer
experience with personalized offers.
